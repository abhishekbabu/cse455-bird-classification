      <h1>Classification of Rice Varieties with Neural Networks</h1>
        
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          Rice, which is among the most widely produced grain products worldwide, has many genetic varieties.
          These varieties are separated from each other due to some of their features. These are usually features 
          such as texture, shape, and color. With these features that distinguish rice varieties, it is possible 
          to classify and evaluate the quality of seeds. Using the 
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection">Rice Image Dataset</a> dataset from Kaggle
          we aim to explore various neural network models to classify five different rice varieties: 
          Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag, which are different varieties of rice often grown in Turkey.
          In particular, we will be applying the transfer learning of three different pre-trained models from the Pytorch library: 
          ResNet18, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet, to the dataset. We will also explore three different optimizers applied to each of the
          aforementioned classifier models. 
        </p>

        <h2>Datasets</h2>
        <p>
          We found our dataset from this kaggle image dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset">
          Rice Image Dataset</a>. This dataset provided a total of 75 thousand images, including 15 thousand images from each rice variety. 
          The dataset also has 12 morphological, 4 shape and 90 color features. To get the data for classification, we first resized, crop at center 
          and normalize all images. We then split the newly cropped images into training, validation, and testing.><br><br>

          To start, we get images like this: <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Preprocessing the data for classification</h2>
        <p>
          Our initial dataset contains images of different rice varieties separated into folders. The training set is
          pre-labeled. To create our dataset for classification, we resized the images to 256x256 pixels, then center 
          crop the images size down to 224x224 pixels, and normalize all the images. We then split the dataset into training, 
          validation, and test sets in a 80:10:10 split. The code to parse the data as well as splitting
          the data can be found in the code folder of the github repository.
        </p>

        <h2>Models and Parameters</h2>
        <p>
          We experimented with utilizing some of the provided models that were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset
          for our specific classification problem. These models are loaded from the torchvision models subpackage.
          We explored these three different pre-trained models:

          <h3>AlexNet</h3>
          Alexnet is a landmark model based on the CNN architecture. 
          AlexNet won the Imagenet large-scale visual recognition challenge in 2012. 
          The model was proposed in 2012 in the research paper named 
          <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3065386">Imagenet Classification with Deep Convolution Neural Network</a> 
          by Alex Krizhevsky and his colleagues.
          
          <h3>ResNet18</h3>
          ResNet is another landmark CNN model that won the ImageNet 2015 competition and has become the most cited neural network of the 21st century.
          ResNet has many variations based on its layer depth, of which ResNet18 is 18 layers deep. ResNet was introduced in 2015 by researchers at 
          Microsoft Research through a paper called <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3065386">Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition</a>.
          
          <h3>SqueezeNet</h3>
          SqueezeNet is a smaller CNN model that was designed as a more compact replacement for AlexNet. 
          It has almost 50x fewer parameters than AlexNet, yet it performs 3x faster, and achieves comparable accuracy to AlexNet on ImageNet.
          SqueezeNet was developed by researchers at DeepScale, University of California, Berkeley, and 
          Stanford University and proposed in a paper named <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360">SqueezeNet: 
          AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and &lt 0.5MB model size</a>. 

          <p>
          We also explored the usage of three different optimizers: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adadelta, and RMSprop, 
          which are used in training for each models, for a total of 9 different combinations.
